I"ž<p>Recently, an <a href="https://www.currentaffairs.org/2016/12/why-you-should-never-ever-listen-to-nate-silver">article</a> was published decrying the usefulness of 538â€™s forecasts of political events and Nate Silverâ€™s opinions. I thought that this was largely misguided, and so got in an argument on Facebook about it. The argument is preserved for posterity, because I basically agree with what I said.</p>
