<ul>
  <li>Thesis of book: deep work is a useful and undervalued way of doing â€˜knowledge workâ€™</li>
  <li>Bookâ€™s advice:
    <ul>
      <li>Take time to work deeply</li>
      <li>Enjoy real downtime</li>
      <li>Practice spending periods of time being free of distraction</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Seems sketchy
    <ul>
      <li>Support for deep work seems like it consists of unpersuasive anecdotes, semi-bullshit science</li>
      <li>That being said, parts of it seem intuitively compelling</li>
      <li>Iâ€™d say itâ€™s worth a shot???</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>hmmmm maybe I should wait until I actually implement scheduling/deep-working to write thisâ€¦</li>
</ul>
